## Description[![](pin.svg)](#introduction)
When creating [MathRankings](https://www.mathrankings.com), the goal was to create a ranking of top mathematics schools based on faculty actively engaged in research across a number of areas of mathematics. At the time, the only ranking that existed was US News and World Report, whose approach is exclusively based on surveys. [MathRankings](https://www.mathrankings.com) approach is entirely metrics-based, measuring the number of publications by faculty that have appeared at the most selective conferences in each area of mathematics.

With our approach, our metrics are unlikely to be gamed, since to publish in such conferences, one must pass rigorous scrutiny. Furthermore, we do not take a citation-based approach, as this has been repeatedly shown to be easy to manipulate. 

With the creation of [MathRankings](https://www.mathrankings.com), you no longer need to visit each departmentâ€™s website in order to gauge research output. You can now filter the top mathematics programs based on your preferred research area. 

See our FAQ for more information.
